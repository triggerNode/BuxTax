If your earnings feel lumpy, that’s normal. Roblox traffic, spending, and payouts swing with school calendars and holidays. Read your CSV, predict the lumps, then turn them into a plan.

## Export your CSV (quick refresher)

- **Personal account:** `roblox.com/transactions` → Type of Transaction: Sales of Goods → download → pick a month (Robux CSV arrives by email).
- **Group:** Configure Group → Revenue → Sales (Sales of Goods) → Download data (monthly CSV).
- If the button disappears or errors, try again later. Roblox acknowledged intermittent UI and rate‑limit issues this summer.

## Make the charts (fast)

BuxTax auto‑parses your CSV and shows three views:

1. **Month over month (MoM)** — Robux and USD side by side so step changes stand out.
2. **7‑/30‑day moving average** — Smooths weekday noise and update spikes.
3. **Year over year (YoY) compare** — With 12+ months, you get the cleanest read on seasonality.

## What 2025 looks like

- **Summer spikes (June–August):** Roblox hit new all‑time concurrent peaks in late August 2025. Expect uplift in sessions, spend, and payouts.
- **December holidays:** Gift cards and time off lift engagement late November/December.
- **School and exams:** May/June exam periods soften playtime. September back‑to‑school often dips.
- **Creator Rewards timing:** Launched July 24, 2025. Awards accrue as **Earned Robux** with a **60‑day hold** before they move to available balance; payouts can lag earnings.

## Turn patterns into a plan

- **Cash‑out cadence:** Schedule DevEx after expected highs, not during dips.
- **Ad budget:** Shift spend into weeks where MoM and the 30‑day average both trend up.
- **Content beats:** Ship updates ahead of known peaks, then watch the 7‑day average for momentum.

## Example data

### Tiny sample CSV (monthly roll‑ups)

```csv
date,robux_revenue,usd_estimate,notes
2025-05-31,120000,420.00,Pre-summer baseline
2025-06-30,160000,560.00,Summer lift begins
2025-07-31,230000,805.00,Peak summer + event
2025-08-31,190000,665.00,Still elevated
```

### Read it

- June lifts above May, July peaks, August stays higher than the baseline.
- If Creator Rewards earnings start on July 24, first payouts appear near late September because of the 60‑day hold.
