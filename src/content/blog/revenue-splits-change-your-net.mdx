Partner splits work, until the math gets fuzzy. Here’s a no‑nonsense way to calculate everyone’s take‑home **after** platform fees and **before** each person cashes out.

## Order of operations (plain English)

- **Platform fees first.** Roblox takes a platform cut at purchase time. For in‑experience sales like game passes and developer products, plan on about **30%**. Marketplace avatar items follow a different schedule; creators earn **at least 30%** with affiliate and platform shares on top.
- **Then split Robux.** Most teams run revshare through **group payouts** or **recurring percentage splits** in Creator Hub. The split happens on **Robux**, not USD.
- **Then each person DevEx individually.** Cash‑out works per account at the current DevEx rate (**$0.0035 per R$**), and only if the person meets eligibility.

> Rule: Never split after DevEx. Split **post‑fee Robux** first, then each collaborator cashes out a personal share.

## The quick model

**Net USD (per collaborator)**  
`= [ (Gross Robux − platform fees) × your split % − agreed shared costs ] × 0.0035`

## Scenarios (pure math)

### A) 70/30 team split (no ad spend)

Assume all revenue comes from in‑experience purchases with a 30% platform fee, then split via group payouts.

|                         |                  Amount |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **Gross Robux**         |              100,000 R$ |
| **Platform cut (30%)**  |               30,000 R$ |
| **Net to team**         |               70,000 R$ |
| **Split 70% (Lead)**    | 49,000 R$ → **$171.50** |
| **Split 30% (Partner)** |  21,000 R$ → **$73.50** |

### B) 50/50 split + 10k R$ ad spend

Ad spend sits in a central bucket and gets deducted **before** the split.

|                            |                           Amount |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------: |
| **Gross Robux**            |                        80,000 R$ |
| **Platform cut (30%)**     |                        24,000 R$ |
| **Net to team (post‑fee)** |                        56,000 R$ |
| **Ad spend (centralized)** |                        10,000 R$ |
| **Net to split**           |                        46,000 R$ |
| **Split 50% / 50%**        | 23,000 R$ each → **$80.50** each |

### C) Publisher‑style split (60/40) + minimum guarantee (MG) payback

Assumptions: an MG of **50,000 R$** was paid earlier by the publisher and is **recouped from the creator’s share**.

|                                       |                                                  Amount |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------: |
| **Gross Robux**                       |                                              200,000 R$ |
| **Platform cut (30%)**                |                                               60,000 R$ |
| **Net to team**                       |                                              140,000 R$ |
| **Split 60% Creator / 40% Publisher** |                                   84,000 R$ / 56,000 R$ |
| **MG recoup (from Creator’s share)**  |                                              −50,000 R$ |
| **Period cash to Creator**            |                                 **34,000 R$ → $119.00** |
| **Period cash to Publisher**          | **56,000 R$ + 50,000 R$ recoup = 106,000 R$ → $371.00** |

Totals reconcile: **34k + 106k = 140k R$**.
