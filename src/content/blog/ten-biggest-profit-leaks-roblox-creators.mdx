## The 10 leaks (with examples and fixes)

### 1) Confusing purchase value vs DevEx cash-out value

Players buying Robux pay retailer pricing. Creators **cash out at $0.0035 per Robux**. Mixing those numbers inflates your USD forecast 3–4×. Plan from **DevEx value**, not what players spend.

**One-line math:** 100,000 R$ → **$350** via DevEx.

### 2) Splitting after DevEx instead of before

Payment fees, tax headaches, and monthly cash-out limits turn a clean 50/50 into a mess. When possible, pay partners **in Robux** with group payouts so each handles their own DevEx and taxes.

### 3) Ignoring marketplace/cut percentages in pricing

For **game passes** and **developer products**, Roblox takes a **30% marketplace fee**. UGC items use a different schedule and often pay creators **about 30% at the floor**, rising only at much higher prices.

### 4) UGC upload fees and catalog costs not baked into price

UGC has **upfront costs**, such as an **upload fee** per accessory. Some categories need a **publish advance** rebated from early sales. If you don’t recover these in your price, you start underwater.

### 5) Ad spend drag, paying for low‑retention traffic

Roblox Ads Manager drives **new users**, but weak **CTR/D1/D7** burns Robux. Without ROAS guardrails, you scale loss‑making campaigns.

### 6) Missing the DevEx threshold (cash flow stalls)

You need **30,000 Earned Robux** to cash out. Teams that plan around 10k or 20k milestones end up stuck.

### 7) Seasonality blindness

Engagement isn’t flat. Time events for high‑engagement periods and gift‑card seasons.

### 8) Not tracking with CSVs

If you skip payout exports, you miss trend breaks, pricing errors, and policy impacts. Small leaks compound.

### 9) Overly generous rev shares or unclear partner terms

Back-of-napkin splits balloon scope and crush margin. Without term limits, minimums, or clawbacks, you owe forever.

### 10) Unverified assumptions (old posts, wrong rates)

Rates, fees, and UGC rules change. Using a 2023 thread can tank your P&L.
