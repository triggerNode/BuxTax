You hit **1,000,000 Robux**. Nice. Here’s what that converts to in **USD**, with fast, clean math you can reuse for your own numbers.

## Baseline: 1,000,000 Robux → USD (2025)

- **Current DevEx rate:** **$0.0037975 per Robux** (=$379.75 per 100,000 Robux).
- **Use these formulas:**
  - Per‑Robux: `USD = Robux × 0.0037975`
  - Per‑thousand: `USD = (Robux ÷ 1,000) × $3.7975`
- **Rate check:** **$0.0037975**.

**Baseline result:** `1,000,000 × 0.0037975 = $3,797.50`

> We treat 1,000,000 Robux as Robux already in your **earned Robux** balance (after marketplace and platform cuts). All scenarios start from that balance.

## Scenario tables

### A) Solo dev, no ad spend

| Step                |         Robux | Notes                         | Net USD (DevEx) |
| ------------------- | ------------: | ----------------------------- | --------------: |
| Gross Robux         |     1,000,000 | Balance available to cash out |               — |
| Adjustments         |             — | None                          |               — |
| **Robux remaining** | **1,000,000** | —                             |               — |
| **Net USD**         |             — | At $0.0037975/R$              |   **$3,797.50** |

### B) Team 70/30 split (split before DevEx)

Assumptions: split is applied to earned Robux in the group or account, both teammates meet DevEx eligibility, one cash‑out per person.

| Step                | Lead Dev (70%) | Teammate (30%) | Notes                                |
| ------------------- | -------------: | -------------: | ------------------------------------ |
| Gross Robux         |        700,000 |        300,000 | 70/30 applied to 1,000,000           |
| Adjustments         |              — |              — | No ad spend or fees in this scenario |
| **Robux remaining** |    **700,000** |    **300,000** | —                                    |
| **Net USD (DevEx)** |  **$2,658.25** |  **$1,139.25** | $0.0037975/R$                        |

### C) UGC‑heavy case (upload + modest ads)

Assumptions: one new avatar item upload (750 R$ upload fee) and **50,000 R$** ad spend to push it.

| Step                |       Robux | Notes                            | Net USD (DevEx) |
| ------------------- | ----------: | -------------------------------- | --------------: |
| Gross Robux         |   1,000,000 | Balance available                |               — |
| Adjustments         |         750 | UGC avatar item upload fee       |               — |
| Adjustments         |      50,000 | Ads to promote UGC or experience |               — |
| **Robux remaining** | **949,250** | 1,000,000 − 50,750               |               — |
| **Net USD**         |           — | $0.0037975/R$                    |   **$3,608.05** |

**Break‑even note:** Those **50,750 R$** in upfront costs require **50,750 R$** of incremental earnings to break even (≈ **$192.78** at DevEx).

## Timeline and expectations

- **Processing time:** First cash‑out about **10 business days**. Returning users about **5 business days**. Weekends and holidays don’t count.
- **First‑time setup:** You’ll get an invite to the payout portal (Tipalti). **Finish tax and payment setup within 1 week** or your request is declined.
- **Frequency:** **One cash‑out per month** maximum.
- **Creator Rewards timing:** Engagement and Acquisition rewards have a **~60‑day hold** before they hit your earned Robux, so your CSV may show a temporary gap before a catch‑up later.
