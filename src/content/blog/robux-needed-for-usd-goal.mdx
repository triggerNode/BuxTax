Want $50? $500? Pick the dollar amount first, then convert to the Robux you need to earn. Keep this simple. Hit the number, DevEx, move on.

## The quick formula

**USD = R$ × 0.0037975**  
also written as **USD = (R$ ÷ 1,000) × $3.7975**

**Verified rate:** $0.0037975 per Robux (= $379.75 per 100,000 R$).  
Reminder: **Purchase value ≠ DevEx cash‑out value.** Players buy Robux at retail; creators cash out Earned Robux at a fixed DevEx rate.

## Quick table: Targets and required Robux

We round **up** so you don’t come up short at cash‑out.

| USD Target | Required Robux (R$) |
| ---------: | ------------------: |
|        $50 |           14,286 R$ |
|       $100 |           28,572 R$ |
|       $250 |           71,429 R$ |
|       $500 |          142,858 R$ |
|     $1,000 |          285,715 R$ |
|  Your goal |         \_\_\_\_ R$ |

**Notes:**

- **Minimum to cash out:** **30,000 Earned Robux** (≈ **$105** at the current rate).
- **Timing:** Submit one cash‑out per month; approval is required.
- **Earned vs bought:** Only **Earned Robux** (from sales or rewards) are eligible, not purchased Robux.

## What changes your target (brief)

- **Revenue splits or group shares:** Splitting earnings (e.g., 50/50) doubles the Robux target for the same USD. Apply the split **before** DevEx. See examples in [DevEx Fees Explained + Examples](/blog/devex-fees-explained-examples).
- **UGC specifics:** Catalog fees, price floors, and creator share lower Earned Robux; set a higher R$ target.
- **Program changes:** Creator Rewards affects **when** you earn Robux, not the **DevEx rate**. Track progress with the [/calculator](/calculator).
- **Taxes:** Plan post‑DevEx with your accountant.
