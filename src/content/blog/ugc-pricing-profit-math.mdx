If you make Roblox avatar items, your earnings hinge on creator share, dynamic price floors, the DevEx rate, and upfront costs. Here’s the math to price with confidence.

## The quick model

**Plain-English formula**

> **Net USD per sale ≈ (Item price in R$ × creator_share %) × 0.0037975 − direct costs per sale**

**Verified inputs (Aug 2025):**

- **Creator share for avatar items:** creators earn **at least 30%** of gross. A progressive share ties to how far your price sits **above the dynamic price floor** (≈ **33%** at **1.15×** floor; up toward **~70%** near **10×**).
- **DevEx rate:** **$0.0037975 per R$**.
- **Upload fee:** **750 R$** per submission for avatar items (incl. emotes).
- **Publishing advance (when required):** refundable; current examples include **1,000 R$** for some accessories and **1,500 R$** for non‑limited emotes.

> Rule of thumb: near the floor, use **30%** for quick math. Higher prices raise your share along the curve.

## Price points vs. take‑home (baseline near 30% share)

| Price (R$) | Creator Share % | Net R$ to Creator | Net USD\* |
| ---------: | --------------: | ----------------: | --------: |
|         75 |             30% |              22.5 |     $0.08 |
|        100 |             30% |              30.0 |     $0.10 |
|        250 |             30% |              75.0 |     $0.26 |
|        500 |             30% |             150.0 |     $0.53 |
|       1000 |             30% |             300.0 |     $1.05 |

\*USD uses DevEx **$0.0037975 per R$** and is rounded.

## Break‑even on upload and promo

If you pay the **750 R$ upload fee**, here’s the **sale count** needed to recoup that **at ~30% share**:

| Price (R$) | Sales to break even\* |
| ---------: | --------------------: |
|         75 |                    34 |
|        100 |                    25 |
|        250 |                    10 |
|        500 |                     5 |
|       1000 |                     3 |

\*Only counts the 750 R$ upload. Add any publishing advance for your category to the target.

## Reality check: demand vs. pricing

- Most non‑limited items sell near the **floor**. Jumping to **2×** for a higher share often crushes conversion.
- Consider bundles/sets where allowed to raise basket value without pushing each item far above the floor.
- Regional pricing affects displayed local prices; your base math still uses R$ and the applicable creator share.
- Placement matters. Watch where sales originate and lean into the channels that convert.
