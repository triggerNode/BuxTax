Need the real-world value of your Robux fast? Use this clean table based on the **current DevEx rate** creators cash out at. No fluff, numbers you trust.

## The quick formula

**USD = (R$ ÷ 1,000) × 3.50**  
Roblox’s **DevEx rate is $0.0035 per Robux ($350 per 100k)** and remains unchanged in 2025, per terms effective 08/01/2025.

> Player purchase prices aren’t the same as DevEx cash-out. This table shows **DevEx take-home before taxes**.

## Robux→USD table (1k–10M)

|      Robux | USD after DevEx |
| ---------: | --------------: |
|      1,000 |           $3.50 |
|      5,000 |          $17.50 |
|     10,000 |          $35.00 |
|     25,000 |          $87.50 |
|     50,000 |         $175.00 |
|     75,000 |         $262.50 |
|    100,000 |         $350.00 |
|    250,000 |         $875.00 |
|    500,000 |       $1,750.00 |
|  1,000,000 |       $3,500.00 |
|  2,500,000 |       $8,750.00 |
|  5,000,000 |      $17,500.00 |
| 10,000,000 |      $35,000.00 |

_How to read:_ divide your Robux by 1,000 and multiply by **3.50**. All figures reflect DevEx **before** taxes or payment-processor fees.

### Quick examples

- **10k Robux** → (10,000 ÷ 1,000) × 3.50 = **$35.00**
- **100k Robux** → (100,000 ÷ 1,000) × 3.50 = **$350.00**
- **1M Robux** → (1,000,000 ÷ 1,000) × 3.50 = **$3,500.00**
