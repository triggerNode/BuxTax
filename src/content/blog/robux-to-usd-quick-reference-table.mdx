Need the real-world value of your Robux fast? Use this clean table based on the **current DevEx rate** creators cash out at. No fluff, numbers you trust.

## The quick formula

**USD = (R$ ÷ 1,000) × 3.7975**  
Roblox’s **DevEx rate is $0.0037975 per Robux ($379.75 per 100k)**.

> Player purchase prices aren’t the same as DevEx cash-out. This table shows **DevEx take-home before taxes**.

## Robux→USD table (1k–10M)

|      Robux | USD after DevEx |
| ---------: | --------------: |
|      1,000 |           $3.80 |
|      5,000 |          $18.99 |
|     10,000 |          $37.98 |
|     25,000 |          $94.94 |
|     50,000 |         $189.88 |
|     75,000 |         $284.81 |
|    100,000 |         $379.75 |
|    250,000 |         $949.38 |
|    500,000 |       $1,898.75 |
|  1,000,000 |       $3,797.50 |
|  2,500,000 |       $9,493.75 |
|  5,000,000 |      $18,987.50 |
| 10,000,000 |      $37,975.00 |

_How to read:_ divide your Robux by 1,000 and multiply by **3.7975**. All figures reflect DevEx **before** taxes or payment-processor fees.

### Quick examples

- **10k Robux** → (10,000 ÷ 1,000) × 3.7975 = **$37.98**
- **100k Robux** → (100,000 ÷ 1,000) × 3.7975 = **$379.75**
- **1M Robux** → (1,000,000 ÷ 1,000) × 3.7975 = **$3,797.50**
