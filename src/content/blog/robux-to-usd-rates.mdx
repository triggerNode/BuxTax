## Robux Value 101: DevEx vs. What Players Pay

There are two very different ways to value Robux:

1. **DevEx rate (for creators):** You earn **$0.0037975 per Robux**. So, 100,000 Robux = **$379.75**.
2. **Player purchase rate:** Players usually pay about **$1 for 80 Robux**, which means they spend around **$1,250** to get 100,000 Robux.

**Bottom line:** As a creator, ignore what players pay. Focus on the DevEx rate. That’s your real payout.
