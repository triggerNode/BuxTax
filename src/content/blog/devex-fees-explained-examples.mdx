If you’re a Roblox creator (solo, small studio, or UGC), your take‑home hinges on two things most people miss: **platform cuts before Robux hit your balance** and the **DevEx exchange rate** when you cash out. This guide gives you the quick math, three real‑world scenarios, and where ad spend plus splits quietly eat into payout. When you’re ready, run your own numbers in the free calculator.

## The quick math

**Formula**  
**USD = (R$ ÷ 1,000) × 3.5**  
(that’s **$0.0035 per Robux** via DevEx. Roblox calls this the “New Rate,” applied to Robux earned on or after Mar 1, 2017. The rate hasn’t changed since then.)

- **Current DevEx rate:** $0.0035/R$ (= $350 per 100,000 R$).
- **Eligibility:** age 13+, minimum **30,000 earned Robux**, verified email, account in good standing, DevEx portal (Tipalti) registration, tax info submitted.
- **Timing:** first cash‑out usually ~10 business days after submission. Returning cash‑outs land in ~5 business days. Sales are subject to **escrow holds** (often ~30 days) before funds fully settle.

## Examples aligned with how creators earn

All examples assume in‑experience monetization (game passes/dev products) where Roblox takes a **30% platform fee**. For a different mix (UGC, subscriptions, affiliate sales), adjust your **earned Robux** first, then apply the same DevEx formula.

> Tip: plug these into the calculator at the end (prefilled link included).

### A) Solo dev, no ad spend

Assume **100,000 R$** in player spend inside your own experience.

| Line item                      |        Amount |
| ------------------------------ | ------------: |
| Gross Robux sales              |    100,000 R$ |
| Less Roblox platform fee (30%) |    −30,000 R$ |
| **Robux you keep (earned)**    | **70,000 R$** |
| DevEx at $0.0035/R$            |      × 0.0035 |
| **Net USD**                    |      **$245** |

Notes: no taxes included. No chargebacks or compliance issues.

### B) Studio deal: 70/30 rev share (your cut 70%)

Assume **200,000 R$** gross inside the experience you co‑own.

| Line item                      |        Amount |
| ------------------------------ | ------------: |
| Gross Robux sales              |    200,000 R$ |
| Less Roblox platform fee (30%) |    −60,000 R$ |
| Robux after platform fee       |    140,000 R$ |
| Team split (your 70%)          |        × 0.70 |
| **Your earned Robux**          | **98,000 R$** |
| DevEx at $0.0035/R$            |      × 0.0035 |
| **Net USD to you**             |      **$343** |

Notes: make sure splits apply **after** platform fees. If your contract splits earlier, adjust the math.

### C) Ad spend drag: 10,000 R$ spent on ads

Assume **120,000 R$** gross, plus **10,000 R$** spent on Roblox ads.

| Line item                           |        Amount |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------: |
| Gross Robux sales                   |    120,000 R$ |
| Less Roblox platform fee (30%)      |    −36,000 R$ |
| Robux after platform fee            |     84,000 R$ |
| Less ad spend (Robux)               |    −10,000 R$ |
| **Earned Robux available to DevEx** | **74,000 R$** |
| DevEx at $0.0035/R$                 |      × 0.0035 |
| **Net USD**                         |      **$259** |

Notes: ads often pay off, but Robux burned on ads aren’t cash‑outable. Budget them like real cash.

## UGC specifics (quick hits)

- **Base shares:** for Marketplace purchases of avatar items, Roblox docs describe a split where the **item creator typically receives ~30%**, the **experience affiliate up to ~40%**, and **Roblox ~30%**. In‑experience purchases of avatar items use the base creator commission.
- **Upload fee:** publishing most 3D avatar items costs **750 R$ per submission** (non‑refundable).
- **Dynamic shares & floors:** Roblox tested **progressive shares tied to price floors**. Recent DevForum threads say pricing above the floor tends to raise the creator share, while in‑experience purchases continue to use base commissions.

## FAQ

**Why is my take‑home so low?**  
Two big hits: the **platform fee (often ~30%)** before Robux reach earnings, and the **DevEx rate ($0.0035/R$)** at cash‑out. If you split revenue or spend Robux on ads, those reduce the DevEx‑eligible balance further. Taxes come after.

**What’s the minimum to cash out?**  
Age **13+** and at least **30,000 earned Robux** (plus verified email, good standing, ID/tax info). Roblox reviews each request and rejects submissions when requirements aren’t met.

**How long does DevEx take?**  
Roblox estimates **~10 business days** for first‑time payouts and **~5 business days** for returning creators (weekends/holidays excluded). Payment processing and sales **escrow holds** add extra days.

**Do team splits or ad spend change the DevEx rate?**  
No. The **rate stays $0.0035/R$**. Splits and ad spend reduce the Robux eligible for DevEx. Deduct those first, then convert the remainder using the standard rate.

**Will Roblox change the DevEx rate?**  
Roblox sets the rate and lists it as **subject to change**. Today’s “New Rate” is $0.0035/R$ (applies to Robux earned since Mar 1, 2017). Future cash‑outs use the **then‑current** rate.

**Is Premium required for DevEx?**  
No. Premium isn’t listed among DevEx requirements. Focus on earned Robux, ID/tax setup, and compliance.
