## Common pitfalls → quick fixes

| Pitfall                                                                 | How to fix                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name mismatch** across DevEx request, Tipalti, bank, or prior payouts | **Do not resubmit.** Open a DevEx ticket to correct name discrepancies, then retry.          |
| **Missing or wrong tax form** (W‑9/W‑8), TIN/SSN mismatch               | Update Tipalti tax form; ensure legal name and exact TIN/SSN (US) or W‑8BEN (non‑US).        |
| **ID verification failed/pending** (blurry, expired, no selfie)         | Re‑verify via Persona with clear, unexpired ID and live selfie; request new link if expired. |
| **Locked out of Tipalti** (lost phone, 2FA loop)                        | Ask Roblox Support to reset Tipalti 2FA or reissue the portal invite.                        |
| **Didn’t finish portal in 7 days**                                      | Submit a new DevEx request and finish portal setup within a week.                            |
| **Insufficient Earned Robux**                                           | Only Earned Robux count; allow up to 72 hours for Wallet updates.                            |
| **Payment method rejected**                                             | Switch to a supported method; verify IBAN/SWIFT and exact payee name.                        |
| **Prior moderation / ToS issues**                                       | Keep the account clean; some violations block DevEx.                                         |
| **Multiple submissions in a month**                                     | Only one completed payout per calendar month.                                                |
| **Unverified Roblox email**                                             | Verify your email in Settings → Security before submitting.                                  |
